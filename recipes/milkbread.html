        <h3>Japanese Milk Bread Loaf (https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/japanese-milk-bread-recipe)</h3>
        <p>
            This recipe is a take on a traditional Japanese Hokkaido milk bread, an extremely soft and pillowy enriched bread which is one of my favourites!
            Preparation involves making a tangzhong paste, which is the secret to creating the soft texture. This bread is fantastic with some jam!

        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <h5>Tangzong</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>3 tablespoons (43g) water</li>

            <li>2 tablespoons (14g) <strong>Bread</strong> Flour</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Dough</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>2 1/2 cups (300g) <strong>Unbleached Bread</strong> Flour</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons (14g) Dry Milk or nonfat dry milk</li>
            <li>1/4 cup (50g) granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon (6g) salt</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon instant yeast</li>
            <li>1/2 cup (113g) milk, whole preferred</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>

        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Prepare the tangzong by adding the ingredients to a saucepan and heating over medium heat. Continuously mix the ingredients until a thick paste
                is formed. Remove from heat and allow to cool in a container.
            </li>
            <li>Combine all ingredients, including the tangzong in a mixing bowl and proceed to mix all ingredients until a smooth dough is obtained.</li>
            <li>Shape the dough into a ball and allow to ferment for approximately 1 to 1.5 hours, until puffy.</li>
            <li>Divide the dough into four even pieces.</li>
            <li>Shape each piece by rolling out into a rectangle, then folding each piece into a log shape.</li>
            <li>Place each piece side-by-side and seam side down in a lightly greased loaf pan. Allow to proof for 40-50 minutes.</li>
            <li>Pre-heat an oven to 180 degrees Celsius while waiting for the dough to proof.</li>
            <li>Brush the top of the proved dough with milk and place in the oven to bake for 30-35 minutes until brown.</li>
            <li>Remove the loaf from the oven and allow to cool on a cooling rack.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
